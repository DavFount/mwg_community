# Community

Community Economy API built for enhanced role play. This system will focus primarily on larger server populations while trying to balance the ability to operate on lesser populated servers via configurable options for your community. This is a work in progress and will take some time to complete. As features are added this readme will be updated. I will eventually have a project board setup so that you can follow development. While this is being developed I highly recommend not running the system as things will change rapidly. If you have any suggestions please feel free to open an issue and let us know.
